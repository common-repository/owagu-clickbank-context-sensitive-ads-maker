Easy context sensitive clickbank ad-helper to place relevant clickbank ads in your widget area's.

== Description ==

Owagu's clickbank ad-helper looks at the content of your wordpress page and places a relevant context sensitive clickbank adblock widget with 2 clickbank links. Works similar to google adsense. Just enter your clickbank ID and place your widget.
This plugin does not rely on database use and therefore does not slow your installation down in any way.
This plugin is not branded (it is free of links back to the maker). In return every 4th pagehit may show clickbank ads with another clickbank ID. This way your wordpress installation stays completely clean of backlinks and hidden advertisements.

Simple & clean moneymaking without any fuss ... !!!
